# TrueCapture

**Production-ready media signing for browser and mobile, built on the C2PA open standard.**

TrueCapture lets anyone cryptographically sign photos and videos at the moment of capture. Each signed file carries an embedded C2PA manifest containing a SHA-256 hash of the content, an ECDSA-P256 signature, and a reference to the signer's public key on [DeDi.global](https://dedi.global), a decentralised key registry. If a single pixel changes after signing, the signature breaks. Anyone with the verify link gets an instant, server-side verdict with no app, no account, and no dependency on TrueCapture infrastructure required.

## Who is this for?

**Journalists and news organisations** Field reporters and newsrooms who need to prove footage is authentic before publication.

**Photojournalists** Photographers whose work needs to be verifiable by editors, fact-checkers, and the public.

**Public figures and politicians** Anyone making official statements who needs protection against fake attribution.

**Doctors and health professionals** Medical practitioners sharing guidance who need to distinguish their content from impersonation.

**Legal and law enforcement** Officers, investigators, and legal teams handling digital evidence that must survive scrutiny.

**Financial institutions** Banks and finance teams protecting high-value authorisation workflows against deepfake fraud.

**Content creators and influencers** Creators who need to prove their content is original and protect against AI impersonation.

**Human rights workers and activists** Field documenters whose recordings of events need cryptographic proof to be taken seriously.

**Anyone** who needs to prove a photo or video is real, unedited, and genuinely theirs.

## SDK

For organisations embedding TrueCapture signing directly into their own apps — BBC, Reuters, AP, or any news org, legal team, or institution that needs their content signed as themselves rather than as TrueCapture.

The SDK supports:
- On-device signing using Secure Enclave (iOS) and Android Keystore (Android) — private key never leaves the device
- Offline signing — works with zero connectivity, syncs when connection returns
- Optional edit chain — extends the C2PA manifest after authorised edits, compatible with Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop
- iOS (Swift), Android (Kotlin), React Native

Status: specification complete, implementation in progress. See [SDK_SPEC.md](./SDK_SPEC.md) for the full technical specification.

## How it works

1. **Capture** — a journalist opens the TrueCapture Chrome extension (or mobile web app at `/sign`) and takes a photo, records video, or captures their screen.

2. **Sign** — the browser uploads the file to the backend signing server. The server:
   - Computes a SHA-256 hash of the raw file bytes
   - Builds a C2PA manifest containing the hash, timestamp, source metadata, and signer identity
   - Signs the manifest JSON with an ECDSA-P256 private key using `crypto.createSign('SHA256')`
   - Embeds the manifest + signature into the file (JPEG APP11 segment, PNG `caBX` chunk, or binary trailer)
   - Stores the verify hash in memory and returns the signed file + a short verify URL

3. **Register** — the signer's public key is registered on [DeDi.global](https://dedi.global), a decentralised public key directory. The manifest embeds the DeDi record ID so any verifier can independently confirm the key belongs to the claimed organisation.

4. **Share** — the journalist pastes the verify URL (`truecapture.global/verify/<hash>`) into their post caption or article. Readers tap it for an instant verdict.

5. **Verify** — the verify page sends the file (or the hash) to `POST /verify` on the backend. The server re-extracts the manifest, re-verifies the signature, re-hashes the content, checks the DeDi key registry, and returns a JSON verdict: `authentic`, `tampered`, or `unsigned`.

### C2PA compliance

TrueCapture implements the [C2PA specification](https://c2pa.org) — the same provenance standard used by Adobe Content Credentials, Google, Sony, the BBC, and the Microsoft Azure AI Content Safety team. Signed files are compatible with any C2PA-aware toolchain.

### Components

| Directory | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `backend/` | Node.js + Fastify signing and verification server |
| `extension/` | Chrome extension — Photo, Video, Screen capture |
| `verify/` | Static site: landing page, `/verify`, `/sign` |

---

## Tech stack

- **Backend** — Node.js 22, [Fastify](https://fastify.dev), `@fastify/multipart`, [node-forge](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge) for key generation
- **Signing** — Node.js `crypto` module (ECDSA-P256, SHA-256, RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5)
- **C2PA embedding** — custom JPEG APP11 / PNG `caBX` / binary trailer implementation
- **Key registry** — [DeDi.global](https://dedi.global) REST API
- **Frontend** — plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript — no build step, no framework
- **Verify crypto** — Web Crypto API (`crypto.subtle`) for client-side fallback; primary verification is server-side
- **Deployment** — [Railway](https://railway.app)

## Quick start (local)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- A [DeDi.global](https://dedi.global) account and API key (free)

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TanushkaCDPI/truecapture.git
cd truecapture/backend
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — add your DeDi API key, org name, and domain
```

See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for all required variables.

### 3. Start the backend

```bash
node server.js
```

On first run the server auto-generates an ECDSA keypair and self-signed certificate in `backend/.keys/` and registers the public key on DeDi.global.

### 4. Serve the verify site

```bash
cd ../verify
npm install
npm start
# Runs at http://localhost:3000
```

### 5. Load the Chrome extension

1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode**
3. Click **Load unpacked** → select the `extension/` folder

Update `BACKEND_URL` in `extension/background.js` to point to your local backend.

## Deployment

TrueCapture is deployed as two Railway services:

| Service | Directory | Domain |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Backend | `backend/` | `api.truecapture.global` |
| Verify site | `verify/` | `www.truecapture.global` |

See [DEPLOY_YOUR_OWN.md](DEPLOY_YOUR_OWN.md) for full step-by-step instructions to run your own branded instance.

---

## Running your own instance

Any newsroom or organisation can fork this repository and run a fully independent instance under their own domain and keypair. Your journalists sign as **"Signed by [Your Org]"** — there is no dependency on TrueCapture infrastructure, keys, or accounts.
